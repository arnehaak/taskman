\section{Environment Setup}

Language used: C++17. No 3rd party dependencies for the main library. \mintinline{text}{catch2} is used for unit testing (included, no manual installation required).

\subsection{Building}

\subsubsection{Prerequisites}
Requires a C++ compiler which is capable of C++17, CMake 3.13 or newer, and some essential build tools (e.g., on Debian: \mintinline{text}{apt install build-essential cmake}).
This documentation can be built with LuaLaTex.

Tested with GCC 8.3.0 (Debian 10) and MSVC 2017 (Windows 8).

\subsubsection{How to Build}
Building on Linux:
\begin{minted}{text}
git clone https://github.com/arnehaak/taskman.git
cd taskman
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
\end{minted}

On Windows with Visual Studio, instead of using \mintinline{text}{make} in the last step, \mintinline{text}{nmake} can be used, or the whole project can be opened interactively in the Visual Studio IDE.

\subsection{Executing}

\subsubsection{Tests}
Some very basic unit tests are included. These tests are not complete; they shall just demonstrate the testing concept and could be extended for real-world usage.

\mintinline{text}{taskman.test.cpp} contains tests for the task manager classes.

\mintinline{text}{policy.test.cpp} contains tests for policies.

In order to launch the included tests, execute \mintinline{text}{example/libtaskman_example} or\\ \mintinline{text}{libtaskman_example.exe}, respectively.

\subsubsection{Demo Application}
A small demo application is provided. This application demonstrates the behavior of the 3 task manager classes.

In order to launch the demo application, execute \mintinline{text}{test/libtaskman_test} or\\ \mintinline{text}{libtaskman_test.exe}, respectively.

\section{Design/Architecture}

\subsection{Overview}
The task manager functionality is provided by a library (\mintinline{text}{libtaskman}) that can be used in applications.
The main API is the \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::TaskManIface} interface.

\subsection{Basic Class Hierarchy}

\begin{plantuml}
@startuml
hide circle
skinparam classAttributeIconSize 0
skinparam minClassWidth 50

abstract  class TaskManIface {
+ add(process : Process) : void
+ list() : vector<ProcessDisplayInfo>
+ kill() : void
+ killPrio() : void
+ killAll() : void
}

TaskMan -up-|> TaskManIface

TaskManFIFO -up-|> TaskMan
TaskManPrio -up-|> TaskMan

TaskMan -right-> PolicyBlocking
TaskManFIFO -right-> PolicyFIFO
TaskManPrio -right-> PolicyPrio
@enduml
\end{plantuml}

Class \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::TaskMan} models the default behavior of the task manager and implements the interface \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::TaskManIface}.

Classes \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::TaskManFIFO} and \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::TaskManPrio} implement the behaviors specified in part 2 and 3 of the exercise.

The only difference between these 3 classes is their policy, implemented in classes \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::PolicyBlocking}, \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::PolicyFIFO}, and \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::PolicyPrio}.

\begin{minted}{cpp}
class TaskManIface
{
  public:
    virtual void add(os::Process const & process) = 0;

    virtual std::vector<ProcessDisplayInfo> list(SortBy sortBy) const = 0;

    virtual void kill(os::Process::PID pid)       = 0;
    virtual void killPrio(os::Process::Prio prio) = 0;
    virtual void killAll()                        = 0;
};
\end{minted}


\subsection{Data Structures}
Choice of data structures explained:

\subsubsection{Main Task Manager Class}
A hash map (\mintinline{cpp}{std::unordered_map<PID, ProcessManagementData>}) was chosen as the main data structure to store all the processes in class \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::TaskManPrio}.
This enables process lookup in \bigo{1}, so that methods \mintinline{cpp}{add()} and \mintinline{cpp}{kill()} can have a runtime complexity of \bigo{1} (depending on the underlying policy).

\subsubsection{Policy: Blocking Behavior}
No data structure needed in \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::PolicyBlocking}.

\subsubsection{Policy: FIFO Behavior}
A doubly-linked list (\mintinline{cpp}{std::list<PID>}) is the main data structure in \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::PolicyFIFO}, as this allows removing elements from the front (PID of the oldest process) and adding elements to the back (PID of the newest process) in \bigo{1}.

There is also \mintinline{cpp}{std::queue} which is a queue with FIFO semantics, which might seem more ideal at first glance, but it does not allow deletion of elements in between, e.g., when deleting a single process or all processes with a certain priority.

\subsubsection{Policy: Priority Behavior}
A custom min-heap data structure (see file \mintinline{cpp}{heap.hpp}) is used in \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::PolicyPrio} to always have the information about the lowest priority process available.
The PID of the process with the lowest priority can be looked up in \bigo{1}. Information about new processes can be added in \bigo{\mathrm{log}(n)}., where $n$ is the number of processes tracked by the policy/task manager.

There is also \mintinline{cpp}{std::priority_queue}, which might seem more ideal at first glance, but it does not allow deletion of elements in between, e.g., when deleting a single process or all processes with a certain priority.

\subsection{Concurrency}
In order to achieve thread safety, the public methods of \mintinline{cpp}{taskman::TaskMan} are protected via a reader/writer lock. Method \mintinline{cpp}{list()} requires only a shared lock, while all other public methods (which modify the internal state) require an exclusive lock. \mintinline{cpp}{std::shared_mutex} with \mintinline{cpp}{std::unique_lock} and \mintinline{cpp}{std::shared_lock}) are used in the implementation.


\subsection{Other Design Choices}

The functionality of the \mintinline{cpp}{list()} method wasn't specified in detail, weather it should print the list itself, or output a structure that can be printed.
I decided to implement the latter, because I don't think printing functionality (or any other UI functionality) should be part of the task manager.
This also enables testing of the task manager functionality.


% \section{Analysis}
% \subsection{Runtime Complexity}



\section{Testing}
Some unit tests are available in the \mintinline{text}{test} directory.
As testing was not the main focus of the exercise, there are only very few rudimentary tests of.


\mintinline{text}{taskman.test.cpp} contains tests for the task manager classes.

\mintinline{text}{policy.test.cpp} contains tests for the policies.

\mintinline{text}{test_sample_generator.hpp} contains a test sample generator.


\section{Demo Application}
A small application that demonstrates the functionality of the \mintinline{text}{taskman} library is available in the \mintinline{text}{example} directory.
